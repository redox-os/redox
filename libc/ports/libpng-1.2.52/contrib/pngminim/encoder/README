This demonstrates the use of PNG_USER_CONFIG and pngusr.h

To build a minimal write-only encoder with embedded libpng and zlib, run

    gather.sh  # to collect needed files from pngminus, libpng, and zlib
    make
 
If you prefer to use the shared libraries, go to contrib/pngminus
and build the pnm2png application there.
