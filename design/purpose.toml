[REQ-0-assertions]
text = '''
Assertions shall be used throughout these documents to mean:
- **shall:** the statement must be implemented and it's
    implementation verified.
- **will:** statement of fact, not subject to verification.
    i.e. "The X system will have timing as defined in ICD 1234"
- **should:** goals, non-mandatory provisions. Statements using "should"
    **should** be verified if possible, but verification is not mandatory if
    not possible. Is a statement of intent.
'''

[REQ-0-prefix]
text = '''
In this project, the following conventions shall apply for artifact names:
 - `ART-0-*` denotes definitions and artifact process only. These will be defined
     as completed, as they are simply documenting the process of artifacts.
 - `ART-1-*` denotes purpose REQs, which detail at the highest level why
     this project exists

Any artifact that is `1` will not be implemented in code (it will only be implemented
by sub artifacts).

The purpose of this prefix is to bring these artifacts to the top when they are listed,
as well as make a simple and clear distinction between purpose documentation and 
design/user requirements.

# Purpose 

Redox is a general purpose operating system and surrounding ecosystem written in
pure Rust. Our aim is to provide a fully functioning Unix-like microkernel, that
is both secure and free.

Redox is an attempt to make a complete, fully-functioning, general-purpose
operating system with a focus on safety, freedom, reliability, correctness, and
pragmatism.

## The goals of Redox

We want to be able to use it, without obstructions, as a alternative to Linux
on our computers. It should be able to run most Linux programs with only
minimal modifications. (see Why Free Software)

We're aiming towards a complete, safe Rust ecosystem. This is a design choice,
which hopefully improves correctness and security (see Why Rust).

We want to improve the security design when compared to other Unix-like kernels
by using safe defaults and disallowing insecure configurations where possible.

## The non-goals of Redox

We are not a Linux clone, or POSIX-compliant, nor are we crazy scientists, who
wish to redesign everything. Generally, we stick to well-tested and proven
correct designs. If it ain't broken don't fix it.

This means that a large number of standard programs and libraries will be
compatible with Redox. Some things that do not align with our design decisions
will have to be ported.

The key here is the trade off between correctness and compatibility. Ideally,
you should be able achieve both, but unfortunately, you can't always do so.

[REQ-1-syscalls]
text = '''
## Syscalls 

The syscall interface should be unix-like without necessarily adhering to
all unix standards.. We shall support at least the 31 most common system calls
includeing open, pipe, pipe2, lseek, read, write, brk, execv, and so on.

Compared to Linux, our syscall interface should much more minimal. This is not
because of the stage in development, but because of a minimalist design.
'''

[REQ-1-schemes]
text = '''
## Scheme / url
A sheme shall be an object used to specify resource descriptors which define 
their own domain (read/write/seek) space. Schemes shall be a generalization of
files which enable for generalization in a less "patchworky" way than
posix.

You can think of schemes as a kind of segregated virtual file system, which can
be arbitrarily structured (they do not have to be tree-like) and arbitrarily
defined by a program. 

Schemes will also be called "urls" in outside documents and the terms will
be equivalent.
'''

[REQ-1-kernel]
text = '''
## The Kernel
Redox's kernel shall be a microkernel. The architecture is largely inspired by MINIX.

Having vastly smaller amounts of code in the kernel will make it easier to find and
fix bugs/security issues more efficiently. The main idea is to have components 
and drivers that would be inside a monolithic kernel exist in user space and 
follow the Principle of Least Authority (POLA). This is where every individual 
component should be:
- Completely isolated in memory and as separate user processes 
	- The failure of one component does not crash other components 
	- Allows foreign and untrusted code to not expose the entire system 
	- Bugs and malware cannot spread to other components 
- Has restricted communication with other components 
- Doesn't have Admin/Super-User privileges Bugs are moved to user space which 
	reduces their power

All of this should increase the reliability of the system significantly and make
redox useful. This for mission-critical applications and for users that want
minimal issues with their computer systems.
