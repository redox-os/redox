## Why hardware reports are needed?

Each computer model have different hardware interfaces, firmware implementations and devices, which can cause the following problems:

- Boot bugs
- Lack of device support
- Performance degradation

These reports helps us to fix the problems above, your report may help to fix many computers affected by the same bugs or missing drivers.

## What if my computer is customized?

You can use the "Custom" word on the "Vendor" and "Model" categories, we also recommend to add your `pciutils` log on [this document link](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/drivers/-/blob/master/COMMUNITY-HW.md?ref_type=heads) to help us with probable porting.

## Status

- Broken - The system can't boot.
- Booting - The system boots with some issues.
- Recommended - The system start with all features working.

## General

This section cover things to consider.

- ACPI support is incomplete (some things are hardcoded on the kernel)
- Only USB input devices are supported
- Wi-Fi is not supported
- GPU drivers aren't supported (only VESA and UEFI GOP)
- Automatic operating system discovery on boot loader is not implemented (remember this before installing Redox)
