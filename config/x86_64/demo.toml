#                             Welcome to Redox!                              #
#                                                                            #
# Redox is an operating system written in Rust, a language with focus        #
# on safety and high performance. Redox, following the microkernel design,   #
# aims to be secure, usable, and free. Redox is inspired by previous kernels #
# and operating systems, such as SeL4, MINIX, Plan 9, and BSD.               #
#                                                                            #
# Redox _is not_ just a kernel, it's a full-featured Operating System,       #
# providing packages (memory allocator, file system, display manager, core   #
# utilities, etc.) that together make up a functional and convenient         #
# operating system. You can loosely think of it as the GNU or BSD ecosystem, #
# but in a memory safe language and with modern technology.                  #
#                                                                            #
