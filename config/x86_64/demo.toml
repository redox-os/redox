#                          Redox Demo Configuration                          #
#                                                                            #
# This file defines the setup of the Redox Demo system.                      #
#                                                                            #
# The "[packages]" section specifies what packages are installed in the      #
# filesystem prior to booting the system. During build, these packages must  #
# have a recipe defined in the config folder (see the Redox Book,            #
# Chapter 5.1). The first group of packages is mandatory for the system to   #
# function, although some items can be removed for special builds,           #
# e.g. The Orbital GUI is not required for a headless server.                #
#                                                                            #
# Items in the "Developer Tools" and "Games" section are optional. You can   #
# add your own programs here.                                                #
#                                                                            #
# The "[users]" section creates user id's and passwords. Each user will have #
# a home directory at boot.                                                  #
#                                                                            #
# The "[[files]]" section contains files needed by the system. If you need   #
# create a file, e.g. a config file for a program you are adding, you can do #
# it here.                                                                   #
#                                                                            #

#                             Welcome to Redox!                              #
#                                                                            #
# Redox is an operating system written in Rust, a language with focus        #
# on safety and high performance. Redox, following the microkernel design,   #
# aims to be secure, usable, and free. Redox is inspired by previous kernels #
# and operating systems, such as SeL4, MINIX, Plan 9, and BSD.               #
#                                                                            #
# Redox _is not_ just a kernel, it's a full-featured Operating System,       #
# providing packages (memory allocator, file system, display manager, core   #
# utilities, etc.) that together make up a functional and convenient         #
# operating system. You can loosely think of it as the GNU or BSD ecosystem, #
# but in a memory safe language and with modern technology.                  #
#                                                                            #
