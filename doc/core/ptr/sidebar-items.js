This in turn implies that the `Unique<T>` is `Send`/`Sync` if `T` is `Send`/`Sync`, unlike a raw `*mut T` (which conveys no particular ownership semantics).  It also implies that the referent of the pointer should not be modified without a unique path to the `Unique` reference. Useful for building abstractions like `Vec<T>` or `Box<T>`, which internally use raw pointers to manage the memory that they own."]]});
