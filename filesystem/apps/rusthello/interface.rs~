\n\n\n\tHOW TO PLAY REVERSI:\n
Reversi is a board game where two players compete against each other. \
The game is played on a 8x8 board, just like chess but for the squares’ colour which is always green. \
There are 64 identical pieces called disks, which are white on one side and black on the other. \
A player is Light, using disks’ white side, and the other one is Dark, using disks' black side. \
The game starts with four disks already placed at the centre of the board, two for each side. \
Dark moves first.\n
Let’s say it’s Dark’s turn, for simplicity's sake, as for Light the rules are just the same. \
Dark has to place a disk in a free square of the board, with the black side facing up. \
Whenever the newly placed black disk and any other previously placed black disk enclose a sequence of white disks (horizontal, vertical or diagonal and of any length), all of those flip and turn black. \
It is mandatory to place the new disk such that at least a white disk is flipped, otherwise the move is not valid.\n
Usually players’ turn alternate, passing from one to the other. \
When a player cannot play any legal move, the turn goes back to the other player, thus allowing the same player to play consecutive turns. \
When neither player can play a legal move, the game ends. \
In particular, this is true whenever the board has been completely filled up (for a total of 60 moves), but games happen sometimes to end before that, leaving empty squares on the board.\n
When the game ends, the player with more disks turned to its side wins. \
Ties are possible as well, if both player have the same number of disks.\n\n\n
\tHOW TO USE RUSThello:\n
To play RUSThello you first have to choose who is playing on each side, Dark and Light. \
You can choose among human players or AIs of various strength. \
Choose human for both players and challenge a friend, or test your skills against an AI, or even relax and watch as two AIs compete with each other: all matches are possible!\n
As a human player, you move by entering the coordinates (a letter and a number) of the square you want to place your disk on, e.g. all of 'c4', 'C4', '4c' and '4C' are valid and equivalent coordinates. \
For your ease of use, all legal moves are marked on the board with a *.\n
Furthermore, on your turn you can also input special commands: 'undo' to undo your last move (and yes, you can 'undo' as many times as you like) and 'quit' to quit the game.\n\n\n
